3. More about PHP
------------------
Syntax of PHP ---> <?php echo "Hello world"; //php code is written inside this opening and closing tags ?>

<?php : Opening Tag
?> : Closing Tag 
semicolon is required to terminate statements

php can be written in blocks as per our need so we can write logics on different blocks

*** We cannot see php in client side as the php is being executed in the server and then it is sent back as response to the client ***
