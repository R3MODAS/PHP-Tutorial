1. Use of PHP
----------------
PHP is a general purpose dynamically typed scripting language which is created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. PHP is written inside html and we can dynamically generate content on different request and send diff response accordingly to the client/user.

2. What is Apache ?
--------------------
Apache is a web server that helps to serve websites using http/https protocol. It handles the request and gives response on the request made by the client.

3. More about PHP
------------------
Syntax of PHP ---> <?php echo "Hello world"; //php code is written inside this opening and closing tags ?>

<?php : Opening Tag
?> : Closing Tag 
semicolon is required to terminate statements

php can be written in blocks as per our need so we can write logics on different blocks

*** We cannot see php in client side as the php is being executed in the server and then it is sent back as response to the client ***

4. Comments in PHP
-------------------
// Single Line Comment
/* 
    Multi
    Line
    Comment
*/

The full form of PHP is Hypertext Preprocessor

5. Variables in PHP
--------------------
Variables are container that contains some information of different type.
Starts with a $ and they are case sensitive. It is a loosely typed language.

Eg : 
----
$name = "Remo";
$age = 23;
echo "Hello, I am $name and I am $age years old" ;

*** <br> to provide newline as there is a html parser in our browser and it takes any text in the form of html ***

6. Datatypes in PHP
-------------------
String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Object, Array, NULL

String -> Sequence of Characters
Integer -> Non decimal number
Float -> Decimal number
Boolean -> True or False

*** We should use var_dump() function to find the type of value and exact value of the Variable ***

*** var_dump(variable) ***

Object -> Instances of classes
Employee is a class where Remo is one object

Array -> Store multiple values in a single variable
$arr = [10,20,30];

Null -> No value just blank
$blank = null;


7. String Functions in PHP
---------------------------
To join a string we can use dot (.) operator.

strlen(string) -> Gives the length of the string.
str_word_count(string) -> Gives the Number of words in a string.
strrev(string) -> Reverse a string.
strpos() -> Returns the position of the string.
str_replace(orginal,changed,string) -> Replaces a substring inside the string.
str_repeat(string,no_of_times_to_repeat) -> Repeats a string.
trim(string) -> To remove whitespaces from a string.

8. Operators in PHP
---------------------
Operators -> Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical

9. Loops in PHP
----------------
if-else, if-else-elseif, switch-case, while, do-while, for, foreach.

foreach is used for array and objects.

Example : 
--------
foreach(arrvariable as define_a_variable) {
    // use that variable you defined here to get all the values which were inside the array.
}

$arr = ["Remo","Rohan","Khushi"];
foreach($arr as $value){
    echo $value;
}

10. Functions in PHP
---------------------
Piece of code that can be reused as many times as we want just by defining it and calling it whenever we need it.

11. Dates in PHP
----------------
date("") -> we have to provide strings to check date related values such as current date, time, get all of the info (date and time)

date_default_timezone_set() -> It is used to set the current timezone we are in and sets the date and time according to it

12. Associative Arrays in PHP
------------------------------
Arrays such as array(10,20,30) are known as numeric/indexed arrays as they have index as keys.

Arrays which has key and value are known as Associative arrays.
Ex : array("Remo" => "Drums", "Harsh" => "Piano")

now use foreach($arr as $key => $value){
    // print the key and value of each array item
}

13. Multi Dimensional Arrays in PHP
------------------------------------
We can make Multi dim array like this (Matrix)
$arr = array(
    array(0,1,2,3),
    array(4,5,6,7),
    array(8,9,10,11),
)

first we get the number of rows in the array 
---------------------------------------------
for($i = 0; $i < count($arr); $i++)

then we need get the index of values inside the array we accessed 
------------------------------------------------------------------
for($i = 0; $i < count($arr); $i++){
    for($j = 0; $j < count($arr[$i]); $i++){
        echo $arr[$i][$j];
        echo " ";
    }
    echo "<br>";
}

14. Scope of Variables
----------------------
Variables defined outside the function are global scoped variables.
Variables defined inside a function are local scoped variables.

We can access the global variables inside the function by using global keyword and it converts the current local variable to global and also the changes done to that global variable will be affected for global scope (All over permanent change).

All the global variables are stored in an Array known as $GLOBALS which is an array which has keys and values.

15. GET and POST methods in PHP
--------------------------------
When the user fills out the form and clicks the submit button, the form data is sent for processing to a PHP file named "form.php". The form data is sent with the HTTP POST method.

$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] -> Gives the Request we made (POST,GET,etc)
$_POST / $_GET -> Superglobal variables which holds some global values

Provide the name attribute to the input fields to access the values submitted :
<input type="email" name = "email">
<input type="password" name = "password">

$_POST["email"] $_POST["password"] to get the global values once we submit the form using POST method.
